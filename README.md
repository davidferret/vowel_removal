# Vowel Removal

This C project removes vowels from user-provided text and allows you to input the text manually or load it from a file. Once the vowels are removed, you can save the processed text to a file for future use.

The way it works is by taking your input, removing all vowels from it, and either displaying the output right away or allowing you to save it to a file. You can choose to enter the text manually, or you can load it from a file. After the processing, the cleaned-up text is shown on the screen, and if you like, you can save it to a file for later reference.

I created this project to make text manipulation easier, especially when working with large amounts of text where vowel removal is needed for certain tasks or analysis. It was a fun challenge to build, and it helped me practice file handling, user input processing, and providing real-time output in a simple way.

## Example Output
